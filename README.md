# Face Skin Disease Classification Using CNN.


This project aims to classify different skin diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a dataset of skin disease images.

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized in the following directory structure:
train/
blackhead/
eksim/
flek hitam/
herpes/
jerawat/
milia/
panu/
rosacea/
tineafasialis/

Each subdirectory should contain images corresponding to the respective class.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow matplotlib
## To train the model
## To make predictions on a new image
